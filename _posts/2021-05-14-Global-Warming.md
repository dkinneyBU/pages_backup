## Will the Earth be as beautiful for my granddaughter as it was for me?

This was a departure for me, as I'm someone who wants to sit and code and let someone else do the "marketing". Ok, bad choice of words. In truth, presentations are not my strong suit, so this really took me out of my comfort zone. And in the end, I really enjoyed doing this and was pretty proud of my final version.

Data exists that proves that every year of the past 40 years has been warmer than the 20th century average. Further, 2016 was the hottest year on record as far back as records exist. The 12 warmest years on record have all occurred since 1998. Globally, the average surface temperature has increased more than one degree Fahrenheit since the late 1800s and the majority of that increase has occurred over the past three decades.

The primary cause is the overloading of Earth’s atmosphere with carbon dioxide. This causes heat to be trapped in the atmosphere and steadily drives up the planet’s temperature. Where does all this carbon come from? The fossil fuels we burn for energy—coal, natural gas, and oil—plus the loss of forests due to deforestation, especially in the tropics.

#### Impacts  

Global warming is accelerating the rate at which sea level is rising. The effect is a dramatic increase in coastal flooding risk, predominantly on the U.S. East Coast and Gulf of Mexico. Wildfires are increasing, and wildfire season is getting longer in the Western U.S. as temperatures rise. 
Dangerously hot weather is on a steady rise as well, and is occurring more frequently than it did in the mid-20th century. 
In addition, climate change has significant negative implications for public health, including increased air pollution and a longer and more intense allergy season. Finally, as temperatures continue to increase, the volume of rain falling during the heaviest downpours increases the risk of flooding.
