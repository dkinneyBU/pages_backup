## Eating habits and health in the United States

It is generally accepted that “eating badly” results in poor health. However, over the course of my lifetime, what constitutes eating healthy has changed, sometimes drastically (such as consuming fat, dairy, etc.). For this project I wanted to see if I could identify any eating habits that would directly correlate to a person being classified as obese (i.e., individuals with a Body Mass Index – BMI – greater than or equal to 30).  

I leveraged the **American Time Use Survey (ATUS) Eating and Health (EH) Module** which contains information related to eating, meal preparation and health in the United States. [1] This overview is provided by the **United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Economic Research Service** website. There is quite a bit of data offered by this module, and through my analysis, I was able to eliminate the majority of it for purposes of this study, In the end, I settled on the following factors that I felt would directly affect obesity: whether or not a respondent consumed soda on a regular basis, whether or not they engaged in exercise on a regular basis, whether they consumed fast food on a regular basis, and how they self-described their overall health.
