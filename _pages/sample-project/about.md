Working backwards through time, I am currently a Data Scientist at Truist Financial in Atlanta. I'm also in my last class for my Masters degree in Data Science from Bellevue University (A's in every class so far! Woohoo!). I'm a Pythonista, a ML/DL/RL/Robotics hobbyist, and a life-long coder. Prior to my current gig, I've spent most of the previous 4 decades as some form of coder (most recently, a full-stack .NET developer. Not that I remember any of that now...) I also hold a B.S in Computer Science and Math from the University of Hartford (Cum Laude) and an Associates in General Science from the S.U.N.Y., that I acquired while I was serving in the U.S. Navy from 1977 to 1981. I am married to a lovely woman from Michigan and share my life with Brutus, Tank (Jack Russells), Pi (chihuaha) and Sidney (tabby cat).
